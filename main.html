        Hello Sou , <br>
    <b>I LOVE YOU </b><br>
       You are the best person I have met in my entire life. There <br> is something I want to
       tell you today. I care for you so <br> much and I also love you a lot.
       Sometimes,I do stupid <br> things and I scold you which you really hate 
       but <br> believe me I hate it too I didn't mean it.
       <br>I want you to forgive me. 
        <br>
        <br>
       And again I love you the most 

       Yours Forever <br>
       Sanket
        
        
    </p>
